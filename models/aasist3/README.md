## Paper

**AASIST3: KAN-Enhanced AASIST Speech Deepfake Detection using SSL Features and Additional Regularization for the ASVspoof 2024 Challenge**

*This is the original implementation of the paper. The model weights provided here are NOT the same weights used in the paper results.*

## Overview

AASIST3 is an enhanced version of the AASIST (Anti-spoofing with Adaptive Softmax and Instance-wise Temperature) architecture that incorporates **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)** for improved speech deepfake detection. The model leverages:

- **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) Features**: Uses Wav2Vec2 encoder for robust audio representation
- **KAN Linear Layers**: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for enhanced feature transformation
- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**: For spatial and temporal feature modeling
- **Multi-branch Inference**: Multiple inference branches for robust decision making

## Architecture

The AASIST3 model consists of several key components:

1. **Wav2Vec2 Encoder**: Extracts SSL features from raw audio
2. **KAN Bridge**: Transforms SSL features using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
3. **Residual Encoder**: Processes features through multiple residual blocks
4. **Graph Attention Networks**: 
   - GAT-S: Spatial attention mechanism
   - GAT-T: Temporal attention mechanism
5. **Multi-branch Inference**: Four parallel inference branches with master tokens
6. **KAN Output Layer**: Final classification using KAN linear layers

### Key Innovations

- **KAN Integration**: Replaces traditional linear layers with KAN linear layers for better feature approximation
- **Enhanced Regularization**: Additional dropout and regularization techniques
- **Multi-dataset Training**: Trained on multiple ASVspoof datasets for robustness

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AASIST3.git
cd AASIST3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Loading the Model

```python
from model import aasist3

# Load the model from Hugging Face Hub
model = aasist3.from_pretrained("MTUCI/AASIST3")
model.eval()
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import torch
import torchaudio

# Load and preprocess audio
audio, sr = torchaudio.load("audio_file.wav")
# Ensure audio is 16kHz and mono
if sr != 16000:
    audio = torchaudio.transforms.Resample(sr, 16000)(audio)
if audio.shape[0] > 1:
    audio = torch.mean(audio, dim=0, keepdim=True)

# Prepare input (model expects ~4 seconds of audio at 16kHz)
# Pad or truncate to 64600 samples
if audio.shape[1] < 64600:
    audio = torch.nn.functional.pad(audio, (0, 64600 - audio.shape[1]))
else:
    audio = audio[:, :64600]

# Run inference
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(audio)
    probabilities = torch.softmax(output, dim=1)
    prediction = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=1)
    
    # prediction: 0 = bonafide, 1 = spoof
    print(f"Prediction: {'Bonafide' if prediction.item() == 0 else 'Spoof'}")
    print(f"Confidence: {probabilities.max().item():.3f}")
```
